 * @author aishwarya.pathak
 * we took 3 variables >> remainder, temp (to store the number) and sum (new/reversed value store krne k liye)=0
 * we have to 1st store the number in temp variable
 * then use while loop for number>0
 * in while loop we did mod of number against 10 and got the remainder >> we are doing this so that we can traverse
 * through the number
 * then we multiplied sum by 10 and added this to remainder
 * we now divide number by 10 so that we traverse more in the number
 * after a point the number wont be greater than 0 and so the loop will stop
 * then we compare the value in sum and temp variables, if they are same it is palindrome otherwise not a palindrome
