 *Fibonnaci series is a series in which the sum of the preceding numbers is the next number
 *we will declare 2 integers already as we need to start somewhere
 *we will then take input from user say which number's series does he want
 *then we will add a and b and then store it in c
 *after this we are printing the value we got in c
 *we are then updating the values of a and b using the swapping method
 *the value in a will be updated to the value in b and value in b will get updated to value in c as we have to add
 *the next two values for the next number in the series
