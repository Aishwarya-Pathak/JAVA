 * A prime number is a number which is divisible by itself and 1
 * To check whether a number is prime or not, we will have to check whether it has any other factors or not
 * so we will say that we have to check whether the mentioned number is completely divisible by any other number other
 * than itself and 1
 * So, we will take a for loop starting from 2 till num-1 coz we don't want to check above mentioned thing with 1 and the
 * number itself.
 * in the loop we will check the remainder i.e. use the mod operator against 2 
 * if this the num%2==0 > we are incrementing a counter for example temp which was 0 already
 * now in the next if else loop, we will decide whether the number is a prime number or not based on this temp
 * if it is >0 >>> it is not a prime otherwise it is a prime number
